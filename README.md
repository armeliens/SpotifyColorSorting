# 🎨 Spotify Playlist by Album Cover Color

This project lets you create a **Spotify playlist where songs are sorted by the dominant color of their album covers**.  
By pulling album art via the Spotify API, the script analyzes each cover’s main hue and reorders the tracks accordingly — offering a uniquely visual music experience.

### 💡 Overview

- Uses the Spotify API to fetch album covers from any playlist
- Analyzes each cover’s dominant color
- Creates a new playlist with the songs sorted by hue

### 🚀 Getting Started

2. Create a new app with the **Redirect URI**:  
   `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
3. Download the [`SpotifyColorSorting.py`](https://github.com/armeliens/SpotifyColorSorting/blob/main/SpotifyColorSorting.py) script  
   *(Click the "Download" button in the top-right corner of the file)*
4. Run the script and enter your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the app you just created when prompted.

### 🎨 Sorting Methods (Used or Under Consideration)

#### 🔹 Most Common Color
- ✅ **Pro**: Fast and simple; captures the dominant hue.
- ❌ **Con**: Doesn’t work well with covers that feature multiple vibrant colors.

#### 🔹 Average Color
- ✅ **Pro**: Extremely efficient; gives a general tone of the image.
- ❌ **Con**: Misleading when strong color contrasts are present.

#### 🔹 Supervised Learning
- ✅ **Pro**: Can sort by aesthetic rules or categories.
- ❌ **Con**: Requires labeled training data and human input.

#### 🔹 LAB / OkLAB / OkLCH
- ✅ **Pro**: Matches human color perception more accurately.
- ❌ **Con**: More complex to implement due to color space conversion.

#### 🔹 Gamma / sRGB Encoding
- ✅ **Pro**: Ensures accurate color representation when averaging.
- ❌ **Con**: Often overlooked; improper usage can skew results.

#### 🔹 Color Quantization
- ✅ **Pro**: Ideal for extracting a small palette of representative colors.
- ❌ **Con**: May miss subtle details or ignore layout/context of the cover.
