# Spotify Playlist by Album Cover Hue
This project allows you to create a new Spotify playlist where your saved songs are sorted by the dominant hue of their album covers. The code extracts album covers from your Spotify library, analyzes the primary color hue of each cover, and then arranges your tracks in the playlist based on this hue order, creating a visually unique musical experience.

### How It Works
- Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and create a new app with the Redirect URI "http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback"
- Download the SpotifyColorSorting.py file
- Inside the script, change "client_id" and "client_secret" with the ones in the new app you just created
- Run the script

### Result
- Playlist created: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0KXOqwKIBnd0dkHb3nWWOT?si=5655e24a429d4bef
- Time: the code spent 45min and 23sec to make a 6076 songs playlist
